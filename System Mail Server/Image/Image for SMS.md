CÃ¡ch Add Image
If you use Markdown (README.md):

Provided that you have the image in your repo, you can use a relative URL:

![Alt text](/relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")
If you need to embed an image that's hosted elsewhere, you can use a full URL

![Alt text](http://full/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
